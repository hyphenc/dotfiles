# fira code issues

the currently available in the offical arch repos and the aur are borked.
at least for dmenu and dwm.

the _one_ package that did work was removed from `community` because i-dont-know.

that's why `otf-fira-code-3-1-any.pkg.tar.zst` is included in my dotfiles.

install with `pacman -U`.
